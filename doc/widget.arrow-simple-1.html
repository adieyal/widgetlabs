    <h1>Simple Table<small> with evenly distributed rows and columns</small></h1>
    <p>This widget renders a simple line graph with a rounded corner on the top right hand side of the bar. Note that the graph has no axis and a composite bargraph with axis is also available in the widget library.</p>
    <p>NOTE: The bounding rectangle for this widget represents the graph area and only specifies the bounds of the actual bars. For a full scale value the text label may extend above the bounding rectangle.</p>
